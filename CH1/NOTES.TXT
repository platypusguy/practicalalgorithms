Source files from Chapter 1

All files in this directory were
linted, compiled, and tested under:
    Borland C++ 4.0 (large memory model)
    Microsoft Visual C++ 1.5 (small memory model)

        bufsize.c  (listing 1-1)

This program reports the number of clock ticks required
to copy a designated file using a variety of optionally
specified input and output buffers. The point
of this program is to quantify the benefits of buffering
on I/O. 

Only MS-DOS versions are provided, because at the time of
the writing there was no *portable* way under UNIX
to measure clock ticks or fractions of a second.
