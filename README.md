# Practical Algorithms for Programmers

Source Code for

PRACTICAL ALGORITHMS FOR PROGRAMMERS
by Andrew Binstock and John Rex (Addison-Wesley, 1995, 16th Printing)

Version 2.1 (as of 1 October 2013)

## Getting Around 

The code for each chapter appears in a separate directory, 
named ch1 thru ch10. In each directory, you will find a file, 
notes.txt, that explains anything that you need to know to 
compile the programs (mostly reminders from the book). It 
also explains any additional files that do not appear in the 
book. These files mostly consist of makefiles and sample data 
files. They are included for your convenience.

Notes.txt also contains any special information needed by
users of UNIX.

## Caveat
This directory is presented here primarily for archival purposesin the hope that it might be useful to readers and students.

Note that this code was originally published in 1995, which means it adheres only to the C89 standard and uses coding conventions that were in vogue at that time. It has been tested only on the major 16- and 32-bit platforms of that period. (See the notes.txt files for more information). 

Save for the six defects that were corrected (see next section), it has not been updated. 

## Errata

Six defects have been identified since the book appeared. They have all been corrected. They are 
discussed in the notes.txt files for chapters 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

We trust that you understand the authors cannot offer
technical support for this product. The book is the manual.

# Reviews from the Press

"If your math challenge comes from working with extremely high precision (dozens or hundreds of digits), you'll nee an abritrary precision math package. Check out _Practical Algorithms for Programmers_ by Andrew Binstock and John Rex. We spend a lot of time implementing various algorithms, so I always reach for a new book on the subject with great hope that ususally leads to disappointment. Why does every single algorithm book cover the same old sorting and searching routines? This book, though, does have the complete source code for an arbitrary precision math package. You also find some neat data compression and CRC code. It's worth the price if you code these sorts of routines." --- Jack Ganssle, _Embedded Systems Programming_, September 1997, p. 127
