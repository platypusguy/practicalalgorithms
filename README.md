# Practical Algorithms for Programmers

Source Code for

PRACTICAL ALGORITHMS FOR PROGRAMMERS
by Andrew Binstock and John Rex (Addison-Wesley, 1995, 16th Printing)

Version 2.1 (as of 1 October 2013)

## Getting Around 

The code for each chapter appears in a separate directory, 
named ch1 thru ch10. In each directory, you will find a file, 
notes.txt, that explains anything that you need to know to 
compile the programs (mostly reminders from the book). It 
also explains any additional files that do not appear in the 
book. These files mostly consist of makefiles and sample data 
files. They are included for your convenience.

Notes.txt also contains any special information needed by
users of UNIX.

## Errata

Six defects have been identified since the book appeared. They are
discussed in the notes.txt files for chapters 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
